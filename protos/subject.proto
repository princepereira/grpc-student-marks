 'message' keyword is used to define a message which will be in turn used as 'request' or 'response'.
 'Names' for 'message' will be in the standard of 'PascalCase' letters.
 The field numbers '1,2,3...' represents the index of values appearing in the encoded streams.
 It can also be represented in '1,3,2..', '1, 3,4' but not '1,2,2...'.

 Field numbers '1-15' take 1 byte to encode, where as field numbers '16-2047' takes 2 bytes.
 So you should reserve the numbers 1 through 15 for very frequently occurring message elements.
